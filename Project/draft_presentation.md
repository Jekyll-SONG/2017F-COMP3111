# Tentative Schedule of Presentation

Please understand that we have 40 groups to present in two days which means one lecture we need to handle 10 groups, i.e. each group has at most 7 minutes after all.

In order to keep a possible logistic, no powerpoint slide is allowed. No laptop is allowed. No live demo is allowed.

You will be able to play a video for at most 2 minutes. The other visual you can provide is a hard copy poster which you need to print 5 copies (A4 size) of it before the presentation and give them to the judge.

If your group is late, it is very possible to be rescheduled to the last group of the presentation. 

Please check the following presentation schedule. Some group in COMP3111H or COMP3111 L2 might be moved to an earlier time slot and vice versa. If it is a time clash in your team and that is impossible, please notify Kevin by email before Friday (24/11/2017).
